Data analysts perform a diverse range of tasks, but here are some typical examples:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Gathering data from various sources like databases, surveys, APIs, and sensors.
Cleaning and preparing raw data by identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
Structuring and formatting data for analysis, often using tools like spreadsheets, databases, and programming languages.
Data Analysis and Exploration:

Performing statistical analysis and calculations to identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
Creating visualizations like charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate insights in a clear and informative way.
Exploring data using various techniques like sampling, filtering, and grouping to uncover hidden patterns and anomalies.
Reporting and Communication:

Performing A/B testing and analyzing the results to measure campaign effectiveness.
Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and developing dashboards for real-time data insights.
Identifying and mitigating data security risks to ensure data privacy and compliance.
Creating machine learning models for tasks like prediction, classification, or anomaly detection.
The specific tasks a data analyst undertakes will vary depending on their industry, company size, and area of expertise. However, the core skills of data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and communication remain central to their role.

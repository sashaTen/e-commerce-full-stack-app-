...how to   create the     login    function    : 
..   you  need to   create the    form in  forms .py   for  login  view   
..   then   you  create  view  function   which   is  
called  by the   url  login  and  then   it checks   if   POST   info 
in the   form  ==  exisiting    user and then    decides  to  
authenticate   or   not 0
..  lastly   you  create    template
...  also   you  can  control the    authentication    .  the   login  ined  
users   can    do  and   cant ..



.......how to   add  items   :
..you  create   forms    :
    from    django   import   forms 
    from  .models   import   Item


    class  NewItemForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class   Meta :
            model =  Item
            fields  =  ('category' ,   'name' ,  'description' ,   'image' ,     'price')


.  then  in  views   you  create the  function   for  it  .  also   include    
the requirenment   of  user  to  be   looged   in. 


..@login_required
def    new(request):
    if request.method ==  'POST' :
        form =   NewItemForm(request.POST ,  request.FILES)
        if  form.is_valid():
            item = form.save(commit=False)
            item.created_by   =  request.user
            item.save()
            return  redirect('detail'  ,  pk=item.id)
    form   =   NewItemForm
    return   render(request ,    'form.html' ,  {'form' : form})



...then    ofcourse   you  create  the  template   
...  also     provide the    urls

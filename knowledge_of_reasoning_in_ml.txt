  a conclusion or make a decision.
 Inference, evaluation of arguments,
and logical conclusion-drawing 
are all components of reasoning.

..read  paper about financial  reasoning 
reasoning  appears  in  models 
bigger   than   100b. 

you can   imrove  it   in  
large  and  in  small  models.
but  in   different   ways .

..read  about improving reasoning in small language models 

getting  the  data  of  reasoning
for  training   is   hard 
and  laos   it  is   limited
to  domain   it  used   on .


few shot examples   help.
CoT  helps .
divide  and   conquer  tehcniques . 
you can  ecplore   the  context 
for reasoning  or  
the     task  like  planning.
!!! maybe    asking  -'why?'   like  
5 why's  for  the   deeper  question.

!!  good   ideas    if  to read  latest
papers  like  for   example  the 
nulti agents  and  try to  use  for 
improving  reasoning   somehow.

Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning
Yao Fu, Hao Peng, Litu Ou, Ashish Sabharwal:

larger
than 100B have strong modeling power, but are
spread on a large spectrum of tasks.
we concentrate their
capacity on a specific target task.
multi-step math reasoning .

prompting like  cot   does 
not   improve reasoning.

this  paper  is  for  cot  reasoning
by  model  Specializing.

i  dont   have to    read   only   reasoning
related   paper    but   
in  different   dierections 
so  i see  the   gaps.

reasoning is the act of thinking
 about something logically and 
 systematically in order to draw
  a conclusion or make a decision.
 Inference, evaluation of arguments,
and logical conclusion-drawing 
are all components of reasoning.

Specializing Smaller Language Models 
towards Multi-Step Reasoning
Yao Fu, Hao Peng, Litu Ou, Ashish Sabharwal:

larger
than 100B have strong modeling 
power, but are
spread on a large spectrum of tasks.
we concentrate their
capacity on a specific target task.
multi-step math reasoning .
 paper addresses the problem of 
 CoT reasoning for
smaller models by model specialization.
prompting like  cot   does 
not   improve reasoning.

..
Our approach is to fine-tune an 
instruction-tuned model
(FlanT5) by distilling chain-of-thought
 reasoning paths of
the GSM8K data from a large teacher
 model 
(GPT-3.5 codedavinci-002
..
earlier said  that   
slms   trained  on the  cot 
get  better   at  reasosing   
but  that  was   across   seversl 
  dimensions   
now  the idea   that   if   focused  on 
one   goal  that  ability   on the  goal  
would   be   improved   a lot .
...

even   llms    have    specializations   
but they  still  can  perform    tasks
  out   of their 
domain ....

instruction finetuning is  training 
the model on
 a dataset of instruction-output pairs.
...
OOD stands for "Out-of-Distribution.
" It refers to data that significantly
 deviates from the data a model was
  trained on.

In the context of your research on
small language models, OOD data
is essentially information 
that the model hasn't seen before,
or that falls outside the range
of examples it was trained on 
during instruction tuning.
....
 The problem here is how to generalize
beyond the tuning data, as small models
 may simply overfit
the tuning distribution but struggle 
to generalize when the
distribution shifts
.....
Our approach of
using data generated from code-davinci-002
 to tune smaller
FlanT5 can be viewed as either distillation
....
so  there   two  works    very   similar  
to   what   they   have   done  
and   they   different  cuz 
1st   paper   did  not   focus  on the  
domain  of  math   
and the  second   paper   did   not 
show   trade   off   of   
generalization  and   did  learn  
the   small   model.


...
!!!  there  some   domains  
that   correlate  for  ex:
math  and   financee.  
biology  and  something .  
and   if   you   train   
in   one   .  for  ex.  t5   
after  math   tuning is  
going  to  perform   better 
in  domain  of    finance .


.....

(MultiArith, ASDiv, 
and SVAMP Wei et al.,
2022b) to show the 
model generalizes to OOD data.

...

In addition to the standard
 finetuning setting where one
  uses the question as the input
   and
use the [CoT, answer] pair as 
the output .

...
!!!  next   paradigma  is  
ai  to  learn   from   fewer
examples  and   abstractions  
.....


s tuning with in-context 
examples improves
the model

...


then test the models in-context 
learning and zero-shot
generalization performance during
 validation. 
 ...


In this work, we study the problem
 of specializing smaller
language models toward multi-step 
reasoning using chainof-thought 
prompting. We show that it is 
indeed possible
to concentrate the small modelsâ€™ 
ability from generic directions 

to the target math reasoning task. 
After specialization,
we show that the model exhibits 
a log-linear scaling curve
where model performance increases 
smoothly as model
scale increases, this is a 
correction of the previous 
hypothesis which believes small 
models have a flat scaling curve
that does not increase with model 
scale. We show the importance of 
using the instruction-tuned 
checkpoints as the base
model because their generalization 
performance is better
than the raw pretrained checkpoints. 
Mutiple tradeoff happens during 
model specialization, including 
the loss of BBH
performance, the balance between 
in-distribution and outof-distribution 
generalization, and the balance 
of in-context
learning and zero-shot generalization 
ability. We hope our
practice and discoveries can serve 
as an important attempt
towards specialized smaller models 
in the new research..

...there   are many    types of   QA  like 
generative 
rule  based 
knowledges based 
info  retrieval 
hybrid   QA (extractive+ generative)
...other  classifiction  of  QA  :  
Extractive: extract the answer from the given context.
Abstractive: generate an answer from the context that correctly answers the question.

...you   have   to   consider  which  type  of  QA  you need.

...you   have to   expereemnt   a  lot  with    code 
and   concepts   in  it    .  let  bard  teach   you 
practice it    .   this   is   how   you  learn  the   coding   part   
and   how  to   work   with    text .

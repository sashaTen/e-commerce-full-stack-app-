Below is a high-level step-by-step guide to help you get started. Keep in mind that the specific requirements and functionalities of your insurtech MVP may vary based on your business model, target market, and goals.

Define Your MVP Scope:

Identify the core features and functionalities your embedded insurtech MVP will offer.
Consider essential components such as user authentication, policy creation, premium calculations, and basic reporting.
Set Up Your Development Environment:

Install Python on your system.
Choose a web framework such as Flask or Django to build your application.
Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking code changes.
Design Your Database:

Choose a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) for storing policy and user data.
Define the data models for policies, users, and other relevant entities.
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication to secure your insurtech platform.
Consider using a package like Flask-Login or Django's built-in authentication system.
Create Policy Creation and Management:

Develop features to allow users to create and manage insurance policies.
Implement validation checks for policy details and coverage.
Premium Calculation:

Integrate a premium calculation engine based on the type of insurance and relevant risk factors.
Implement algorithms or rules for determining premium amounts.
Implement Basic Reporting:

Create basic reporting features to provide users with insights into their policies.
Use charting libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib for visualizations.
Integrate Payment Processing:

Implement a secure payment gateway to handle premium payments.
Consider using payment processing libraries or services like Stripe or PayPal.
Testing:

Write unit tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of your code.
Perform integration testing to validate the interactions between different components.
Security Measures:

Implement security best practices, including data encryption, secure coding practices, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
Deployment:

Choose a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for deploying your insurtech MVP.
Configure your production environment and set up any necessary infrastructure.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Implement monitoring tools to track system performance and detect issues.
Establish a plan for ongoing maintenance and updates.
User Feedback and Iteration:

Release your MVP to a limited audience and gather user feedback.
Iterate on your insurtech platform based on user input and identified areas for improvement.

once   you   have    foundation   (MVP /PROJECT)
then     filter  and   implement   knowledges  that   you  collected  over 
long    period  in  notes   like the   snowball  

.......

overall    plan   : 
slm   sentiment into  app 
research    slm 
learn   how to    write   good  code 
and  database   design and basics of  mlops and  devops
........


starting   business  is  like the  research
you  find    problem   then  analysse    solutions
then  check  metrics  and   benchmarks  
and then   experemnt  and   implement 
your    solution 
............
remember that   knowledge  is   evil and  good. 
so  just    get    familiarity  so   you    know  the   principles and the   big   picture 
collect    knowledges    in  notes.  refer   when   you  need .   
how to  know    when   it   is   time to  refer . 
make    simplified  plan   and that's  it.   first  learn   what  it  is   exactly the  hard  way.

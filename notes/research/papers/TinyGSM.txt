TinyGSM: achieving > 80% on GSM8k :

* how  the   good datasets  arethe  key to  the imporoving the reasoning of SLMs
*TinyGSM  is the  dataset  of the high school math   with   python  solutions  generated  by the gpt 3.5
*their  approach    combines  the  TinyGSM  dataset  with verifier
*GSM8K  is the   golden    benchmark    for that  project 
* it  is   idea  to    look  for the   other   reasoning   techniques like  PoTD 
CoT  and   ecot and then    maybe  find   the  way  to   combine  them   like the    mix of thought  which 
combines   several   datasets   into   one.
*Phi-1.5-tiny 125M+125M
code verify48@1
68.9
Phi-1.5-small 350M+350M 71.3
Phi-1.5 1.3B+1.3B 81.5

*  my  plan  is   to  :
1 reproduce the paper   of   reasoning
2 experement  a lot 
3 keep   reading    many  papers   both    deeply  and   surface things
